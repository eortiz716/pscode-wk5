// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

For x (first number) + y (second number), print z (sum of x and y)

// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

IF x%2=0, print "even"
IF x%2!=0, print "odd"

// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following.    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

a) user enters 5 numbers (a, b, c, d, e)
b) print solution to (a+b+c+d+e)/5
c) For number of largest value, print value of that number. For number of smallest value, print value of that number
d) For step b, print "The answer to step b is [answer to b]. This answer was derived from adding the five numbers together and dividing by the number of numbers." For step c, print "The answers to step c are [answers to c]. [Largest value] is the largest value, and [smallest value] is the smallest value of the collection of numbers."
